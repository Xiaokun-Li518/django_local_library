Just to give you some idea of how this works, the code fragment below demonstrates how you would implement the class-based view as a function if you were not using the generic class-based detail view.

def book_detail_view(request, primary_key):
    try:
        book = Book.objects.get(pk=primary_key)
    except Book.DoesNotExist:
        raise Http404('Book does not exist')

    return render(request, 'catalog/book_detail.html', context={'book': book})
Copy to Clipboard
The view first tries to get the specific book record from the model. If this fails the view should raise an Http404 exception to indicate that the book is "not found". The final step is then, as usual, to call render() with the template name and the book data in the context parameter (as a dictionary).

Alternatively, we can use the get_object_or_404() function as a shortcut to raise an Http404 exception if the record is not found.

from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404

def book_detail_view(request, primary_key):
    book = get_object_or_404(Book, pk=primary_key)
    return render(request, 'catalog/book_detail.html', context={'book': book})

#That's it! The generic view will query the database to get all records for the specified 
# model (Book) then render a template located at /locallibrary/catalog/templates/catalog/book_list.html 
# (which we will create below). Within the template you can access the list of books with the template variable 
# named object_list OR book_list (i.e. generically "the_model_name_list").

# You can add attributes to change the default behavior above. For example, 
# you can specify another template file if you need to have multiple views 
# that use this same model, or you might want to use a different template variable name if 
# book_list is not intuitive for your particular template use-case. Possibly the most useful 
# variation is to change/filter the subset of results that are returned â€” so instead of listing 
# all books you might list top 5 books that were read by other users.
